# Essence frontend extension - a "research copilot" for Chrome

See [essence.fyi/chrome](URL) for a demo.

## Usage

Developing on a Mac >= 13.0.1, one should first run:

```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

then, using yarn in development mode,
```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn watch
```

The build folder can then be loaded to Chrome or zipped and uploaded to the Chrome store.
